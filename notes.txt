Character Data (used for discreet pieces of data, data broken down to its minimums)
------------------------------------------
Char is a fixed length;
Varchar is a variable length;

Always go up one in the data text to allow room foe expansion in tables
Text Data: (the numbers next to the text fields are bytes)
------------------------------
Tinytext: 225 bytes
Text: 65,535 bytes
Mediumtext: 16,777,215 bytes
Longtext: 4, 294, 967, 295 bytes

Numeric data:
(can be signed (allows both negative and positive numbers) or unsigned (allows only positive numbers)

------------------------------------------
            Signed			Unsigned 
Tinyint: 	-128 to 127		0 to 255
Smallint: 	-32k to 32k		0 to 65k
Mediumint	 -8mil to 8mil		0 to 16mil
Int 		-2bil to 2bil		0 to 4bil
Bigint 		-9quin to -9quin 	0 to 18qin

Temporal data: (dates and times)
--------------------------
Date		YYYY-MM-DD
dateTime 	YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS
timestamp 	YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS
year 		YYYY
time		HH:MI:SS
now()		current dateTime

floating point
---------------------
float(p,s) 1.E+38 p = how many digits total on the left and right 
                  s = how many digits on the right of the decimal

double(p,s) 1.E+308
decimal(p,s)

17.389
float(4,2)
17.39 // total(P) = 4 digits; on the right(S) = 2 digits; 

--ALL INFO BELOW IS CALLED A C.R.U.D

--CREATE 

INSERT INTO people (fname, lname) VALUES ('Bob', 'Jones');

-- READ (This is typically first)

SELECT * FROM people;

--UPDATE 

UPDATE people set phone='601-321-7654', gender='M' WHERE fname='Bob';

--DELETE

DELETE from people WHERE fname = 'Bob';

USE 'select 'column_name' from 'table_name' order by 'column_name'' to get a list of things in a certain column in an ordered format

Orphan data: something deleted from the database that has no more relation to the table (NEEDS TO BE PREVENTED)

Adding a 'deleted_at' column helps with keeping data that may have been accidentally deleted
